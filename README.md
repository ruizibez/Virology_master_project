# Abstract
Viroids are the smallest known pathogens. They are characterized by their non-coding RNA nature and 
high mutation rates. Due to their inability to encode proteins, their structure is the only way for them to 
interact with the host and thus perform their functions. However, their small size limits the domains available 
for interaction with different proteins, which implies that their high mutation rate could be a tool for generating 
alternative forms to increase the number of possible interactions. This research proposes a pipeline for the 
complete study of the diversity and structural variants of HSVd that could support the hypothesis previously 
aforementioned, in addition to facilitating the development of an experimental design optimized for this 
purpose. Thus, this bioinformatic analysis allowed us to study the behavior of variable sequences over time 
and to investigate nucleotide diversity. As a result, hot spots of change were identified and subsequently 
validated by means of variant calling. In addition, specific variants with structural impact were detected and 
some were confirmed through haplotype reconstruction. Based on the above, the experimental design for 
obtaining variable mature forms of HSVd was optimized.
